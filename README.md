Test Console
==================

Interactive console for running tests

Please note : This console was written to aid with testing a specific application

Feel free to pinch any code from it but the console itself has only been tested in a few specific environments and can't be regarded as production code.

Yet...

### Using the console

To use the console, cd into your tests folder and type

  > test_console

To run a test type

  > run path/to/test.rb

  or

  > run folder/to/test
